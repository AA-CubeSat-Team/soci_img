Status:
- Not under development

Write a piece of code which uses less than 15 kilobytes of memory that generates a
picture of smaller size, whether it be a thumbnail or a resized version of the picture.
The generated thumbnail should have a size that is significantly less.

test_picture1.jpg, test_picture2.jpg, and test_picture3.jpg are provided as sample
pictures to use for this thumbnail generation.

Corresponding hex dump of the image is provided in text files, so as to save you
the trouble of using a hex editor.
